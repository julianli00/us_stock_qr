# Canonical US equity research

`julianli00/us_stock_qr` is the canonical home for integration code, research
definitions, failed trials and reviewed progress. This is research software,
not authority to trade or to modify user-maintained holdings.

## Separate research lanes

| Lane | Preserved evidence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Incumbent Top30 | Static 699-stock, 126-day momentum, inverse-volatility monthly strategy; saved 2015-01-02 through 2026-05-08 result | CAGR 29.54%, Sharpe 1.1867, drawdown 28.31%; full-sample selection, not independent OOS; fails the 15% drawdown gate |
| Early watch | Price/volume plus optional event evidence; legacy prices/signals through 2026-08-20 | September evidence cannot validate August signals; historical news/Reddit coverage incomplete |
| [Isolated workbench](research/workbench/README.md) | 52 registered configurations through 2026-10-05; zero joint 10-year/5-year passes | Separate package/environment, different objectives and assumptions; forward record remains paused |
| Manual holdings | Private user-maintained facts | Never loaded, overwritten or published by the research reporter |

The checked baseline is in
[`config/research_strategy_registry.json`](config/research_strategy_registry.json).
It is a dated, curated record, **not a live market refresh**. Existing local
strategy and holdings material is preserved; only an audited subset is published.
No existing parameter search or broker workflow is automatically activated.

## Safe daily research report (Python 3.9+)

The local incumbent environment is retained. A new installation can use a
separate Python environment and `pip install -r requirements-reporting.txt`.
The reporting core itself uses only the standard library; the compatibility
module retains its existing pandas/requests dependencies.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -B scripts/test_research_reporting_guard.py
.venv/bin/python -B scripts/send_slack_signal_once.py --dry-run
```

Preview is the default. It reads no credentials, performs no HTTP requests, and
writes no outbox, legacy state, logs, positions or fills. Legacy Slack callers
and previews now use the same canonical bridge before the old mixed-date
builder/hash. Legacy `force`, signal paths and account options cannot opt back
into that trading payload. Discord behavior is unchanged.

Real delivery requires explicit `--send` and the locally configured
`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`; never put its value in a command, repository or issue.
The intended cadence is after 06:00 Asia/Shanghai, with a bounded 15-minute
catch-up invocation and one report per completed NYSE session. The pinned
calendar covers 2024-2028, including known early closes and ad-hoc closures;
missing, modified or out-of-range calendars fail closed. Future unexpected
exchange closures require a reviewed snapshot update.

The private outbox is under `artifacts/private/research_reporting/`. Its lock
and atomic writes prevent ordinary repeat/restart/concurrent duplicate sends.
A timeout or crash after reservation is **UNKNOWN**, not success or permission
to retry. Incoming webhooks cannot prove remote exactly-once delivery after an
ambiguous acknowledgement; reconciliation is required. An HTTP 200/`ok`
receipt is not a claim that channel history was independently read.

## Point-in-time watch input contract

Without an independently supplied, verified watch snapshot the report is
status-only and emits zero ideas. It remains useful: rules, dated historical
results, blockers, progress and optimization priorities. It never fills a
five-name quota or turns stale records into current price-level advice.

An optional local producer may supply four files under
`artifacts/private/research_reporting/watch/`:

- `snapshot.json`: schema 1, origin `us_stock_qr`, strategy ID
  `early_accumulation_signal_v1`, session, timezone-aware `decision_at`,
  `order_authority: false`, `input_sha256` and `ideas`.
- `prices.json`: `rows` with ticker, exact session, positive close,
  timezone-aware first `known_at`, and `basis: adjusted_close`. Every idea
  and SPY/QQQ/VIX must have the same completed-session cutoff.
- `events.json`: `rows` with event ID, ticker, original `published_at`,
  first `known_at`, and a public HTTPS source URL. Publication and availability
  must precede the decision; neither generated-at nor a backdated label proves
  point-in-time availability.
- `universe.json`: session, `point_in_time: true`, first `known_at`, and members.

The three input files use canonical JSON (`sort_keys=True`,
`separators=(",", ":")`, no trailing newline); their SHA256 values must match
`input_sha256`. The decision must be between exchange close and the pinned
30-minute finalization deadline. An idea references matching event IDs, has
its original signal/first-observed session, a stable signal ID and rationale.
Optional research levels must form a valid entry/stop/target range. All inputs
are checked, not just a global maximum date. Published idea identities are
not treated as NEW again. Synthetic examples are in the guard test.

This contract does not create missing point-in-time data, independently prove
provider timestamps, or grant trading authority. There is deliberately no
automatic adapter from the old news CSVs, broker snapshots or holdings importer.

## Isolated imported runtime

`research/workbench` contains exactly the manifest-selected source, tests,
public configuration, dependency constraints, notices and sanitized evidence.
Its `us_quant` package requires Python 3.10+ and must not be installed into the
incumbent Python 3.9 environment or added globally to `PYTHONPATH`.

```bash
cd research/workbench
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[paper,dev,research]' -c requirements-research.lock
.venv/bin/python -I -B -m pytest -q
```

Paper adapter source is retained for reproducibility, not activated. No broker
configuration, raw cache or evolving forward ledger was imported. The reporter
reads only `evidence/research_status.json`, never invokes the workbench CLI.

## Progress and publication

See [integration status](docs/integration/STATUS.md) and
[`docs/research_progress.json`](docs/research_progress.json). GitHub progress
uses reviewed explicit commits/PRs, **not a configured daily automatic push**.
The Slack job cannot run git or publish files.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -B scripts/check_publication.py
# Stage only the listed, reviewed paths; never git add .
.venv/bin/python -B scripts/check_publication.py --staged
```

The publication allowlist excludes raw artifacts, environments, account
configuration, holdings/importer modules and the original private handoff.
